# Angular-TUI

Since [Toast UI](https://ui.toast.com/) does not have angular components/wrappers, I started this library to implement them myself.  
Currently I've only implemented a basic version of their [image-editor](https://ui.toast.com/tui-image-editor).  
See the tui-image-editor-angular project's [README](projects/tui-image-editor-angular/README.md) for installation instructions.
